how to create a theme translation:
----------------------------------
1.      determine the standard language code to use, e.g. "en" (or "en-GB", "en-US" …), "de", "es" etc.
        Read this document on how to choose a language code:
        http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags
        
2.      make a copy of 'lang.example.php' and rename as 'lang.en.php' where "en" is the language code for your translation
        (do not rename, modify or delete 'lang.example.php')

3.      if you have not already, make a copy of 'theme.config.default.php' and rename it to 'theme.config.php'.
        within that file add your language code, separated from any other languages by a space, to the `THEME_LANGS`
        option; this will tell NNF that your language is available to use and will add it to the theme's language selector

4.      translate the text within your lang file. please note that all text is HTML.
        you can preview as you go by selecting your new language when running NNF

<h2 id="links">Links:</h2>
<p>
        Clickable links will be created automatically on any web addresses in your text that begin with
        "<samp>http://</samp>", "<samp>https://</samp>", "<samp>ftp://</samp>" or "<samp>irc://</samp>".
        Also, e-mail addresses will be turned into clickable links for you.
</p>
<pre>
YES:    http://www.google.com
NO:     www.google.com
YES:    email@email.com
</pre>

<h2 id="names">Names:</h2>
<p>
        You can refer to another person by prefixing their name with an at-symbol. E.g. "<samp>@bob</samp>"
        The name will link to the last reply made by that person in the current discussion thread.
</p>

<h2 id="bolditalic">Bold &amp; Italic</h2>
<pre>
*Write bold text like this*, and _italic text like this_.
</pre>


<h2 id="titles">Titles:</h2>
<p>
        For a title, start a line with two colons. Example:
</p>
<pre>
:: Shopping list
</pre>

<h2 id="dividers">Dividers:</h2>
<p>
        To draw a line across your text, use three or more dashes:<br>
        (this should be on its own line, with a blank line before and after)
</p>
<pre>
---
</pre>

<h2 id="quotes">Quotes:</h2>
<p>
        To quote somebody else's text, place it on its own line with quote marks at the beginning and end.
        This applies even if the quoted text is more than one paragraph, or contains quotes itself.
</p><p>
        There must be a blank line between any quote and other text:<br>
        (a single line-break will not work)
</p>
<pre>
YES:    This is my text
        
        "This is your text"
        
        This is my text
</pre>
<p>
        There must be no text before or after the quote marks:
</p>
<pre>
NO:     "This is your text".
</pre>
<p>
        However, spaces before or after are allowed. When you copy and paste someone else's quote,
        extra spaces might be included, these will be ignored.
</p>
<pre>
YES:    This is my text

             "this is your text
        
        "
        
        This is my text
</pre>
<p>
        A quote may span more than one line or paragraph:
</p>
<pre>
YES:    This is my text
        
        "The quick brown fox
        jumped over the lazy dog
        
        Jackdaws love my big
        sphinx of quartz"
        
        This is my text
</pre>
<p>
        Quotes can contain quotes:
</p>
<pre>
YES:    "This is the first quote
        
        "This is the second quote"
        
        This is the first quote"
</pre>
<p>     
        You may use three different kinds of quote marks:<br>
        (but you can’t mismatch the ends)
</p>
<pre>
YES:    "Plain speech marks"

        “Curly quotes”
        
        «Guillemots»
</pre>
<p>
        Different kinds of quotes can be nested:
</p>
<pre>
YES:    "This is the first quote

        “This is the second quote
        
        «This is a third quote»”"
</pre>

<h2 id="pre">Monospace Text:</h2>
<p>
        For small snippets of code or technical writing you want to appear as-is admidst other writing you can use
        backticks (1 or more allowed) to enclose the monospace text; the text within will not be processed for bold /
        italic and other markup.
</p>
<pre>
Use `<samp>*bold*</samp>` for bold and ``<samp>_italic_</samp>`` for italics.
</pre>
<p>
        When posting, all unnecessary white-space is automatically removed. If you have some text that relies upon a
        monospace font (such as ASCII art), you can use a "code block".
</p><p>
        The code block begins with a percent sign, then your text (starting the next line),
        and then the ending percent sign on the next line.
</p>
<pre>
%
      __...--~~~~~-._   _.-~~~~~--...__
    //               `V'               \\ 
   //                 |                 \\ 
  //__...--~~~~~~-._  |  _.-~~~~~~--...__\\ 
 //__.....----~~~~._\ | /_.~~~~----.....__\\
====================\\|//====================
                dwb `---`
%
</pre>
<p>
        Note that there should be a blank line between the code block and any other text before or after:
</p><p>
        You can include a title after the first percent sign, for example when inserting source code snippets you can state
        the programming language used:
</p>
<pre>
% CSS
div     {color: red;}
%
</pre>
<p>
        Should you need to quote something that has percent symbols as the first character on a line, such as the LaTeX
        programming language, you can simply use the dollar sign "<samp>$</samp>" as a delimiter instead.

        This discussion forum is powered by <a href="http://camendesign.com/nononsense_forum">NoNonsense Forum</a>
        (here after “NNF”). As a forum, NNF is unique in what and the way it stores information,
        notably in what it <em>doesn’t</em> store, compared to other forums.
</p>

<h2 id="collected">Information Collected:</h2>
<p>
        The only information you are asked to provide is a name, password and the text that you wish to publish.
</p>

<h2 id="stored">Information Stored:</h2>
<ul>
        <li><p>
                The name and message you provide is stored as part of the discussion feed and made public.<br>
                The name can be any text and you do not have to use your real name or any identifying moniker
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
                The password you provide is one-way encrypted once received and stored only in this encrypted form —
                this means that NNF (and the site owner) does not know your password and cannot recover it
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
                If this forum provides selectable translations then changing the display language will set a
                <em>cookie</em> specifying your chosen language.
        </p><p>
                A <em>Cookie</em> is a small piece of text stored on your computer used to remember some kind of
                interaction with a website, in this case which language you have selected. NNF only uses cookies to
                remember the language selection and does not track you in any way. It is completely safe to delete the
                cookie
        </p></li>
</ul>

                Please note that NoNonsense Forum is free, open-source software, adaptable by anybody with sufficient
                knowledge; this forum may be collecting additional information beyond this privacy policy.

        <li><p>
                Almost all websites collect visitor information, which typically includes details such as your I.P. address,
                time of access and web browser (also possibly operating system) identifying mark.
                These details are typically used for measuring traffic and finding faults. None of this information is
                collected by any part of NoNonsense Forum itself; again, contact the website owner with any questions
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
                The search feature is controlled by a third party (usually <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>),
                and will certainly collect information. Please check their website for their privacy policy
